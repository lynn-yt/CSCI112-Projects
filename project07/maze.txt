When the maze is solved with a linked stack structure, the stack commits to one direction and follows it through until there are no more choices left and the algorithm has to backtrack. However, the array queue structure does not necessarily  commit to one specific direction. It treats all paths equally. While using this structure can be less efficient than using a linked stack when there is just one solution to the maze, if there are multiple routes through the maze to find the solution, an array queue would be a more efficient structure to use. For example, in scenarios where there are more than one path from the start and only one path which leads to the solution, solving the maze with a linked stack structure may lead the to a very long route with a dead end whereas solving with the array queue structure will in this case lead to a solution faster as it incrementally goes in all possible directions.
