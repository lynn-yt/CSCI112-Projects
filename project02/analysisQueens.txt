According to the profiling of nQueensBrute and nQueensFancy, brute runs significantly more times than fancy. This is because the complexity of brute is O(n^n) since every space needs to be compared to every other space in the brute force method. On the other hand, fancy has a complexity of O(n^k) due to the back tracking method that does not require that all spaces are compared. We also noticed that when profiling fancy, the size of the board does not correlate to a greater number of calls because the algorithm sometimes backtracks more times than others. For example, for a board of size 4, the number of calls is 66, while for a board of size 5, the number of calls is 41. \
